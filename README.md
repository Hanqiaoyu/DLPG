# Selective Uncertainty-aware Dual Annotations Learning (SUDA)

> This work proposes a Selective Uncertainty-aware Dual Annotations Learning (SUDA) framework to generate pseudo-labels closer to GT for noisy samples.

## ðŸ§  Introduction

Medical image segmentation often suffers from **noisy annotations**, which limits the performance of deep learning models.  
This project introduces **SUDA** â€” a novel **Selective Uncertainty-aware Dual Annotations Learning** framework designed to:

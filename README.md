# Dual-Label Guided Pseudo-label Generation with Selective Uncertainty (DLPG)

> This work proposes a Dual-Label Guided Pseudo-label Generation with Selective Uncertainty (DLPG) framework for Medical Image Segmentation under Noisy Labels.

## ðŸ§  Introduction

Medical image segmentation often suffers from **noisy labels**, which limits the performance of deep learning models.  
This project introduces **DLPG** â€” a novel **Dual-Label Guided Pseudo-label Generation with Selective Uncertainty (DLPG)** framework designed to:

## ðŸ”§ Dependencies

> To be added â€” e.g., PyTorch, NumPy, SimpleItk etc.

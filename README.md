# Dual-Label Guided Pseudo-label Generation with Selective Uncertainty (DLPG)

> This work proposes a Dual-Label guided Pseudo-label Generation with selective uncertainty (DLPG) framework for medical image segmentation under noisy labels.

## ðŸ§  Introduction

Medical image segmentation often suffers from **noisy labels**, which limits the performance of deep learning models.  
This project introduces **DLPG** â€” a novel **Dual-Label guided Pseudo-label Generation with selective uncertainty** framework designed to:

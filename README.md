# Selective Uncertainty-aware Dual Labels Learning (SUDL)

> This work proposes a Selective Uncertainty-aware Dual labels Learning (SUDL) framework to generate pseudo-labels closer to GT for noisy samples.

## ðŸ§  Introduction

Medical image segmentation often suffers from **noisy labels**, which limits the performance of deep learning models.  
This project introduces **SUDL** â€” a novel **Selective Uncertainty-aware Dual labels Learning** framework designed to:

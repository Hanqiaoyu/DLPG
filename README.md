# Selective Uncertainty-aware Dual Annotations Learning for Medical Image Segmentation with Noisy Labels (SUDA)

> This work proposes a Selective Uncertainty-aware Dual Annotations learning (SUDA) framework for medical image segmentation with noisy labels.

## ðŸ§  Introduction

Medical image segmentation often suffers from **noisy labels**, which limits the performance of deep learning models.  
This project introduces **SUDA** â€” a novel **Selective Uncertainty-aware Dual Annotations learning** framework designed to:

# Dual Annotation Learning with Selective Uncertainty for Medical Image Segmentation with Noisy Labels (DASU)

> This work proposes a Dual Annotation learning with Selective Uncertainty (DASU) framework for Medical Image Segmentation with Noisy Labels.

## ðŸ§  Introduction

Medical image segmentation often suffers from **noisy labels**, which limits the performance of deep learning models.  
This project introduces **DASU** â€” a novel **Dual Annotation learning with Selective Uncertainty ** framework designed to:
